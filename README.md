# guilddkp
Additions to the original GuildDKP  by Mimma to fit current release of WOW API.

The main focus at this version (1.5.2) is the following functionality:  
  
* /gdhelp                               - for help menu
* /gddkp playername                     - for requesting DKP status of playername | default playername is own name
* /gdaddraid int:amount                 - for adding int:amount of DKP to entire raid | no default
* /gdadd playername int:amount          - for adding int:amount to playername | no default
* /gdminus playername int:amount        - for subtracting int:amount from playername | no default
* /gdclass class                        - for getting top 10 players and their dkp standing | default class is own class
